# How we reported this story

The Beacon compiled its database of Kansas City-area cryptocurrency ATMs by manually downloading the HTML files for individual locations from CoinATMRadar.com. The site is frequently cited in financial and legal documents to describe the scope of the cryptocurrency ATM market.

From those files, we extracted details such as store location, operator names, installation dates, cryptocurrencies offered and more into a single database and standardized dates, street names and latitude/longitude points. This data can then be overlaid over a street map of the Kansas City area.

We also overlaid bank branch locations in the region using data from the FDIC.

In a separate database, we downloaded data from the U.S. Census’ most recent five-year estimates from its American Community Survey. The data includes estimates of Black and Latino residents, and includes people who identify as those races alone or in combination with other races. We also downloaded data on estimated foreign-born populations and median household income. We use “block groups”, or the smallest geographic unit of measurement available for the five-year ACS.

We then narrowed the ATM locations and Census data to focus only on Jackson, Clay, Platte, Johnson and Wyandotte counties. The resulting heatmaps for each variable were then merged with the crypto ATM location map to show proximity of kiosks to areas with higher numbers of Black and Latino people or lower median household incomes.

# What are the limitations?

Individual ATMs are not tracked by regulators at the state or federal level. CoinATMRadar solicits location data from ATM providers, so its database may miss some locations that were not submitted to the site.

The Census data used for these maps are five-year estimates ranging from 2017 to 2021. The pandemic may have had an impact on certain datasets, such as household incomes decreasing due to job loss, or potentially increasing due to stimulus payments, unemployment benefits and other income from government sources.
